CS498stkFinalProject
====================

Project Description:

There are so many people in your life who share the same interests. You might never realized how much you are in common with those “strangers” around you. So, we are trying to build an application which helps you make new friends with those people who you don’t want to be just strangers.


Features:
- Get user's current location (by Html5 geolocation and Google Map API) .
- Allow users to edit their personal interests, as well as view other people’s profile. Those interests are cached and saved into datastore.
- Chat with people nearby ( implemented with Channel API ). Chatting history is saved into the browser’slocalStorage.
